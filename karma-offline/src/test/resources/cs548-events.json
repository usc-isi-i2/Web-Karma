		{
			"id" : "l:glav" ,
			"title" : "Logical data integration: answering queries using views (GAV, LAV, st-tgds)" ,
			"description" : "We describe the formal approach to data integration: (1) defining  mappings between source and target schemas, using logical rules/queries/st-tgds, and (2) reasoning with these rules to rewrite queries posed over the target schema to executable queries over the source schemas. We describe the virtual approach to data integration where the data remains at remote sources and the data integration system (mediator) retrieves the data in real time in response to user queries. " 
		} ,

		{
			"id" : "l:data-cleaning" ,
			"title" : "Data cleaning" ,
			"description" : "Data cleaning is a major headache in information integration because most datasets contain errors that need to be corrected before the information is usable.

		} ,

		{
			"id" : "l:schema-mapping" ,
			"title" : "Schema Mapping" ,
			"description" : "Different datasets often use different schemas even when they contain information about the same topic. In order to integrate these datasets it is useful to identify a mapping between the attributes in these datasets so that one can combine them into one integrated dataset. In this class we cover techniques for automatically identifying mappings between schemas." 
		} ,

		{
			"id" : "l:rdf-mapping" ,
			"title" : "RDF mapping tools" ,
			"description" : "A popular and useful technique for integrating datasets (databases, delimited text files, XML or JSON) is to map them to RDF.

		{
			"id" : "l:owl2-profiles" ,
			"title" : "OWL2 Profiles: QL, EL, RL" ,

Web wrappers are programs that extract data from Web pages and return it in a structured format, typically XML. Several libraries exist for programmers to develop such wrappers. There has been significant research on techniques to generate wrappers by example so that users who don't know how to program can generate wrappers. In this lecture we cover several systems that use this approch and discuss the algorithms that they use." 
		} ,

		{
			"id" : "l:wrapper-learning" ,
			"title" : "Semi-structured Data: Wrapper Learning" ,

		{
			"id" : "l:mashup-principles" ,
